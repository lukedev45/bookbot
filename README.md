# 📚 BookBot – Text Data Analyzer in Python

**BookBot** is a simple Python command-line program that reads a plain-text book file, computes statistics (such as word count and character frequencies), and prints out an easy-to-read report.

This project was built as part of a **Boot.dev Python project** to practice file handling, string processing, and writing clean, modular Python code.

BookBot is designed as a beginner-friendly but *real* Python project:

- Learn **file I/O** in Python
- Practice **string manipulation**
- Separate logic into reusable functions
- Build confidence working with real text data
